\title{Antimicrobial Resistance in Organic and Conventional farms: A

We identified 1836 references in three search databases: Pub Med, Web of
Science, and PubAg, from studies published between 2000 and 2022. The
studies reported the point prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in
Organic and Conventional farms. Three duplicates were removed, and the
remaining 1833 unique references were subjected to relevance screening,
with 1744 references being removed. After assessing the remaining 89
references for eligibility, 17 were removed. The systematic review
included 72 studies that met our criteria (\emph{fig.1}). The United
States of America accounted for 44\% (n=32) of the surveys. Italy,
Germany and Spain accounted for 5 surveys each, Sweden had 4 surveys
while the remaining countries contributed between 3 and 1 survey each.

\paragraph{Antimicrobial resistance trends in Organic and conventional
farms}\label{antimicrobial-resistance-trends-in-organic-and-conventional-farms}}

There was higher resistance in conventional farms as compared to organic
farms between 2001 and 2020 except in 2016 where the median resistance
in organic farms was higher than in conventional farms. The median
resistance decreased from 43\%-8\% in organic farms between 2016-2020
then increased to 22\% in 2020.The same trend was observed in
conventional farms where the median resistance decreased from 35\% to
18\% between 2016 and 2019, then sharply increased to 38\% in 2020.

You can also embed plots, for example:

\includegraphics{AMR-manuscript_files/figure-latex/pressure-1.pdf}

Note that the \texttt{echo\ =\ FALSE} parameter was added to the code
chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
